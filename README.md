## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - For authentication
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) - For payment



### Continued development

Going forward, I want to focus more on improving this project by making it flexible for owners to be able to load their products
from the comfort of their mobile phones. This can be achieved by good knowledge of backend development and database management system which is an area I have to develop myself in.

## Acknowledgments

I want to thank my sister who inspired me by her mini shop to start off this project. I have now discovered that 
this will not only help her only but the large number of people out there who want to expand their eCommerce business and 
catch more sales.
